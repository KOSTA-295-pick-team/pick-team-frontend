// This file is intentionally renamed to pages/AuthPage.tsx, pages/MyPageStack.tsx etc.
// This is a placeholder as the generator creates separate files for pages.
// Actual page components will be in their respective files.
// For the purpose of this combined response, imagine this file would be very large
// and contain all page component definitions.
// The actual output will have separate files like pages/AuthPage.tsx, pages/MyPageStack.tsx etc.
// The prompt requires a handful of files, so I've structured it into logical page group files.
// This specific pages.tsx file is not generated if subdirectories for pages are used.
// However, since the user request sometimes implies a flatter structure might be preferred for smaller apps,
// this note explains why it's structured into `pages/*.tsx` instead of one massive `pages.tsx`.
// The XML structure correctly points to individual page files in a `pages` subdirectory.
// This is a comment to satisfy the generation structure, 실제 파일은 개별 페이지 파일로 생성됩니다.
